          I&apos;m a Software Engineering student at York University with a passion for building impactful solutions. 
          Currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at Quarkle.ai and Lead Software Developer at OneTimeTable, 
          where I&apos;m creating tools that help students save time and improve their academic experience.

          My experience spans full-stack development, AI/ML research, and automation. I&apos;ve developed platforms that 
          serve hundreds of users, automated workflows that save 90+ hours weekly, and conducted research on 
          explainable AI for medical applications at IIT Roorkee.

          I&apos;m particularly interested in educational technology, AI applications, and building tools that make a 
          real difference in people&apos;s lives. Whether it&apos;s helping students manage their schedules, automating 
          tedious workflows, or making AI more transparent, I&apos;m driven by the impact technology can have.
